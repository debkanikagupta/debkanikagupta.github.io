description              : &description "I hold a PhD in Economics from Newcastle University pending minor corrections, with a research specialisation in macroeconomics, particularly applied to emerging economies. I am proficient in both theoretical and empirical methodologies. I have a master's and bachelor's in economics, with a minor in statistics and mathematics. My teaching portfolio spans undergraduate and postgraduate levels.\\ I have contributed to teaching as a seminar leader, lecture developer, and marker across various courses at Newcastle University, mainly in macroeconomics. My commitment to high-quality teaching has been recognised through the award of Associate Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA). I have also helped with outreach programmes at Newcastle University as a postgraduate panelist.\\ I have a growing publication record (one published, two submitted, and one policy report) and have presented my work at several major conferences across the world. I have received accolades such as First Prize for Best Poster Presentation at Newcastle Universityâ€™s Doctoral Conference (2024). I have also received two scholarships, a conference grant and am awaiting the outcome of two fellowships. I have managed multiple research assistance projects under senior academics such as Professors Giorgio Fazio, Sugata Marjit, and Simon Hussain. I have independently planned and organised two international academic conferences. I have contributed to departmental service through roles such as PhD student representative and university panelist for outreach programmes.\\ Future Research: Over the last decade, trade disruptions like the US-China trade war, COVID-19, Brexit, and tariffs given the presidential elections of the US have placed the UK at the center of a perfect storm. I plan to develop multi-country DSGE models and Structural Bayesian VARs to analyse these issues, with three research papers in mind."
